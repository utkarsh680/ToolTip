<h1>Tooltip</h1>

In React, a tooltip is a common user interface element used to provide additional information or context when the user hovers over or interacts with a specific element, such as a button, link, or icon. Tooltips are usually displayed as a small pop-up box near the element being hovered over, containing a brief description, hint, or explanation.

There are multiple ways to create tooltips in React, including using existing libraries or building custom tooltips from scratch. I'll explain a basic approach to creating tooltips in React using CSS and event handling.
